## Academic Projects

### Implementation of Digital Filter in Real Time
Oct 2018
Guide: Dr. Nafisuddin Khan
Course: Digital Signal Processing
* Designed and implement FIR and IIR digital filters in real time on the DSP C2000 LaunchPad using audible signals and tones acquired in 4 different channels and the option to mix these signals individually.
* Obtained a good response from the stopband,analyzed how the signal are supressed when the frequency generator is set to stopband frequency value.

### Latch and flip-Flop characterisation in ngspice
Nov 2017
Guide: Dr. Naveen Jaglan<br>
Course: Digital Electronics
* Optimized size of latch and flip-flop to minimize Setup and Hold time window.
* Computed D to Q delay and clock to Q delay using simulations in ngspice.

### Lane and Vehicles Detection Pipeline
Oct 2017  
Guide: Dr. Meenakshi Sood
* A computer vision software pipeline built on top of Python to identify vehicles in a video.
* Computed Camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients for distortion correction to raw images.
* Uses color transforms, gradients, Sobel, HOG feature extraction on a labeled training set of images, Vehicles classifier and Linear SVM classifier.
* Works as a pipeline on a video stream to create a heat map of recurring detection frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles and etermine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to the center.


## Hackathons & Workshops

### IoT based Pollution Monitoring and Waste Management for smart cities
**Smart Cities Hackathon**  
Nov 2017  
+ Established communication between dustbins & Municipalities across the city with server on web using existing network.
+ Conceptualized the Route Optimization using Google maps. Used python Requests library for sending coordinates stored.
+ Used Arduino, JS, Google Maps API and Backend of program runs on flask. Won 3rd Prize in Smart City Hackathon

### Underwater Glider for Real Time Mapping with SensorTag IoT System
**Techfest**
+ Accomplished automated glider controlled movement with a ballast system.
+ Developed obstacle-avoiding feature and algorithm for mapping of environment using MATLAB
+ Interfaced TI CC2650STK SensorTag with Raspberry Pi to retrieve data in real time.

### Object Follower Robot
**Murious 2017**  
Jan 2017  
- Implemented image detection algorithms using openCV for a WSAD robot which can follow a specified path using the directives sent by overhead camera whose recorded images were processed and movement were instructions generated.
